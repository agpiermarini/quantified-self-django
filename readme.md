# Quantified Self API (Django)
This is a Python/Django API of which the ostensible purpose is to interface with the [Quantified Self Front End](https://agpiermarini.github.io/quantified-self-fe-django/) calorie tracking application.

The Quantified Self API allows a user or application to post and consume data for foods and meals, and is currently deployed on Heroku at https://quantified-self-python-django.herokuapp.com/.  

Local setup instructions and information regarding each of the available endpoints, are detailed below.
